### About me

I'm Wilma, a developer from North America. I started projects such as [Semaphorin](https://github.com/y08wilm/Semaphorin) which is a tool to tether downgrade compatible iphones to older ios versions without blobs and [Skype](https://github.com/y08wilm/Skype) which is a remake of Skype 7 designed using Java Swing and third party libraries. My favourite programming language is Java, but I am trying to get better at mobile app development too. If you are interested in my personal life, I'm a comp sci student and apple internal enthusiast. I like roller skating, playing volleyball and cycling with friends.
